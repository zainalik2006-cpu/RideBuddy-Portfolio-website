## Goal statement

RideBuddy is a motorcycle telemetry + safety system I’m building to capture ride data and turn it into useful insights.
The end goal is a compact Raspberry Pi setup that logs **IMU + GPS** data and uses **sensor fusion + event detection** to highlight things like lean angle, hard braking, rough road segments, and potential incidents.

I want this to be both:
- a real tool I can use on my own bike, and
- a solid embedded/data engineering case study (hardware → data pipeline → analysis).

## Where I am right now

Right now I’m in the **bring-up phase**:
- I have the **IMU wired up and communicating with the Pi**
- I’m getting consistent sensor readings (accel/gyro/mag) and verifying they look sane
- Next I’m focused on clean sampling + stable timestamps so the data is actually usable later

## What I built

- Basic IMU read loop (accel/gyro/mag)
- Quick sanity checks (stationary readings, axis directions, noise level)
- A simple log format so I can replay/debug later

## What I learned

- Getting “data” is easy — getting **reliable data** is the real work
- Small issues (rate, units, drift, timing) matter *a lot* once you start doing fusion/event detection

## Next steps

1. Lock down sample rate + timestamping
2. Add basic filtering (noise reduction)
3. Start orientation/lean angle estimate (fusion v1)
4. Bring in GPS logging and sync it with IMU timestamps
